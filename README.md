# Visual Place Recognition Paper List
Visual place recognition (VPR)/Loop closure detection (LCD) papers. This project mainly concerns deep learning-based methods, covering various aspects, including approaches based on **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, **auto-encoders (AEs)**, **generative adversial networks (GANs)**, **feature fusion** and **transfer learning/domain adaptation** and so forth, and challenging problems such as **long-term**, **across seasons**, **heterogeneous data fusion** and etc.

- The papers will be classified acoording to their specific topic, likes following pictures.
